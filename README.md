Social networking sites (SNS) such as Twitter can capture wide varieties of information of every user
ranging from psychological attributes to life-style preferences. To extract valuable knowledge from this ocean
of information was the prime motivation for this project.

Efforts were made to extract userâ€™s eat-out preference from his/her tweets using a dataset of tweets from 671 social
networkers who were active both in Twitter and Foursquare. These tweets were processed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning model (Classification-Regression) was built to predict eat-out
preference in different categories of restaurants. Both training and testing scores of all applied algorithms were presented. The described workflow and tools can be utilized in targeted marketing applications.
